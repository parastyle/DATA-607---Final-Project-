Data Collection
========================================================

Indeed was the source of our job postings for this analysis as it’s currently one of the most used job search engine.  

Vast number of skills led our team to aggregate skills into key groups.  

Prior to running an analysis, the data had to be validated for full use.  In looking at all the data, we noticed that each category wasn't sufficiently being reprsented.  

Boxers only had 11 samples in over 200.  Any analysis on this small of a sample may not be statistically valid and therefore this category was segmented out accordingly leaving only boxer brifes, briefs and trunks.
