## DATA 607 Final Project

May 2017

Team: Cesar Espitia, Michael Muller, Ilya Kats

### Objective

A new underwear brand is being launched that caters to the larger, more stylish gentlemen. Currently, the startup has one type of underwear designed (boxer briefs), but there is interest in picking one more type of underwear to include in the line. Additionally, so far there has been little analysis in how to price the produst. Complete market research done by a dedicated research firm such as Mintel, IBISWorld or Gartner is cost prohibitive for the startup. The goal of this analysis is to provide the company with the starting point in how to price and brand their line in the marketplace using freely available data. 

### Conclusion

The data collected provides strong starting guidance to the startup in determining direction of their underwear line. Trunks is a popular type of underwear with a similar pricing distribution of boxer briefs, so the startup should consider adding this type to their line. Approximate price point of a pair is $25-$35. 

Not suprisingly, higher income increases spending in the undergarments category. The startup should consider targeting consumers based on their income level. Those with a household income of greater than $50,000 tended to have a higher spending.  

### Limitations of Analysis

Both price data and BLS income/spending data cover only US market. Factors governing other markets can differ significantly and this analysis should not be extended beyond the US market. 

This analysis provides information only about a couple of factors relevant for market research. There are other factors that could be and should be researched, such as consumer buying habits, market size, market growth or decline, and any current trends. Managing the design and launch around the data driven process can generate confidence in business model assumptions. 

The analysis covers price data from three major retailers. The retailers are typical for a certain market segment. However, results may not fully transfer to other market segments. Startup should take care in applying results making sure that assumptions and data sources fit the business model.
