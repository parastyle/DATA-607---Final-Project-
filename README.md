## DATA 607 Final Project

Spring 2017

Team: Cesar Espitia, Michael Muller, Ilya Kats

### Proposal

A new underwear brand is being launched that caters to the larger stylish gentlemen.  The brand founders have decided to launch with a boxer-brief and one other style but aren’t sure which one.  Since they’ve been more focused on actual product design, the founders haven’t had an opportunity to do a market analysis / competitor set analysis to determine key factors including pricing, color offerings, and size offerings.  They know they are going to target the mid-tier to high end price point.  The goal of this project is to find freely available data to create a market analysis that will help them in making their decisions.
